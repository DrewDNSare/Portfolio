The Application contatained here is a completely command-line based App that allows the use to select options from a menu where they can add, remove, update, sell , and view sales. 

This app was developed over 15 hours total across 2 weeks and showcases my ability to utilize functions and mudularize code. 

While this app does not yet have a permanent database; meaning that changes made are forgotten after it is exitted , I have plans to develop a second version that has a proof-of-concept front end, with a permanent data structure stored on a pickled file.

There are also further plans to implement a full-fledged database via SQLite or similar solution, as well utilize Object Oriented Programming to show off skills progression. 

Errors are handled through print statements and break points built into VS Code. I have plans to implement good error handling practices with try , except in future iterations of this project
